## Hosted with GitHub Pages

We host our bot on GitHub pages, this means that our website code and pages are constantly up for people to visit, download, and take inspiration from. Our bot is in a private repo, connected to a different account & everything is backed up on a thumbdrive. No source code for our bot(s) are available for download.

If you have not already joined, please come visit our discord channel to make use of our free/paid resources!
